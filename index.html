                    <h3>Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA</h3>
                    <p>As a Senior Data Scientist at NRCS, I initiated and led the annual NPAD data refresh process using R scripts, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy. I also upgraded an existing R script to enhance the security and compliance of sensitive USDA data. Additionally, I developed a novel Python-based solution for processing CPAMS survey data, streamlining data analysis and facilitating more accurate insights for decision-making.</p>

                    <h3>Penn State University, Hershey Medical</h3>
                    <p>At Penn State Hershey Medical, I identified bottlenecks in capacity audits and built a centralized data warehouse using PostgreSQL to connect separate systems. I designed and built dashboards using Grafana to highlight hospital overnight capacity and staffing deficiencies, reducing time to insight from 5+ days to real-time. I also developed time-series forecasting models using ARIMA, Python, and R to predict radiology demand and revenue, enabling strategic decisions on radiology center staffing.</p>

                    <h3>Air National Guard</h3>
                    <p>As a Database Architect at the Air National Guard, I conducted end-to-end development of new grading and academic record-keeping features using SQL, PHP, and HTML to track student graduation progress. I deployed new database queries and aggregations enabling population-level analysis on student cohorts, surfacing insights impacting graduation rates. I also maintained the SQL database, coordinated with stakeholders to gather requirements, and created ad-hoc custom queries for reporting needs.</p>

                    <h3>Novel Use of Chatbot Technology to Educate Patients before Breast Biopsy</h3>
                    <p>Developed a chatbot using Botkit.AI, Node.JS, and Glitch to provide patients with accessible information and resources regarding breast biopsy and treatment. Conducted a literature review, analyzed patient language patterns using AntConc and SAS, and performed statistical analysis to validate the chatbot's responses. Created a backend service, designed a user-friendly mobile interface, and developed a decision tree architecture that enabled patients to select topics based on lifestyle, procedure info, side effects, and mental health. In a pilot study, 87% of patients noted an improvement in sentiment after using the chatbot.</p>
