            <h3>Novel Use of Chatbot Technology to Educate Patients before Breast Biopsy</h3>
            <p>Developed a chatbot using Botkit.AI, Node.JS, and Glitch to provide patients with accessible information and resources regarding breast biopsy and treatment. Conducted a literature review, analyzed patient language patterns using AntConc and SAS, and performed statistical analysis to validate the chatbot's responses. Created a backend service, designed a user-friendly mobile interface, and developed a decision tree architecture that enabled patients to select topics based on lifestyle, procedure info, side effects, and mental health. In a pilot study, 87% of patients noted an improvement in sentiment after using the chatbot.</p>

        <h3>Machine Learning & Data Science to Support Patient Care</h3>
        <p>Identified an opportunity to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of plantar fasciitis using machine learning techniques. Conducted a comprehensive analysis of MRI data from patients, employing clustering algorithms and feature importance ranking to uncover distinct patient subgroups with shared imaging characteristics.</p>
        <p>Developed a robust data pipeline to preprocess and integrate complex medical imaging data, ensuring data quality and consistency. Collaborated with domain experts to validate findings and ensure clinical relevance. Utilized Python, scikit-learn, and data visualization libraries to build and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including K-means clustering and Random Forest Classifier.</p>
        <p>Uncovered 3 to 4 unique patient subgroups, each associated with specific pathological processes, such as myxoid changes and collagen loss. Identified key imaging features, like STIR signals and fascial tears, that play a crucial role in differentiating these subgroups. These insights lay the foundation for personalized treatment plans tailored to each patient's specific condition, potentially improving outcomes and quality of life for those suffering from plantar fasciitis.</p>
