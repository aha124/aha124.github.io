            <h3>Novel Use of Chatbot Technology to Educate Patients before Breast Biopsy</h3>
            <p>Developed a chatbot using Botkit.AI, Node.JS, and Glitch to provide patients with accessible information and resources regarding breast biopsy and treatment. Conducted a literature review, analyzed patient language patterns using AntConc and SAS, and performed statistical analysis to validate the chatbot's responses. Created a backend service, designed a user-friendly mobile interface, and developed a decision tree architecture that enabled patients to select topics based on lifestyle, procedure info, side effects, and mental health. In a pilot study, 87% of patients noted an improvement in sentiment after using the chatbot.</p>
